How it works:
Program asks the user !IN A LOOP! to enter a positive integer UNTIL  '0' (ZERO).
Then the program should pring from those which have been read in,
Those one , for which the SUM of digits is the largest (and this sum).
The program uses two languages: Polish and English. Which are
definded on a PREPROCESSOR

If Pol is defined , then language is Polish 
If Eng is defined , then langeage is English
If BOTH OF THEM ARE DEFINED, then it basically shouldn`t compile. 


RECOMMEND TO READ ABOUT PREPROCESSOR OR WATCH THE VIDEO BELLOW!!!!
