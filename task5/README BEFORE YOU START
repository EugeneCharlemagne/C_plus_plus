The idea is to create a survey , 
which contains from 7 variables:
sex , marital status , age group , education , place of living , region of the country , answer;

They have to be encoded into one variable of type 'unsigned short' (2 byte);

the function , takes 7 numbers , and then encodes them. 
Whole function works using bit operations.
