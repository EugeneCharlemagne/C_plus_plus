Small Introduction to the task:
Here we are difining 3 classes and "enum class (recommend not to use just only 'enum', because it sucks...)";

In the main function, we are creating an array of Couples with data already inserted.

We have to find the best couple from those putted into array.
That`s why we create function 'bestClient' which will return the Pointer
to this couple from the array of 'size' size passed as the first argument
which has the highest total savings of HE and SHE. But 
only from those couples for which at least one of the spouses has an acocunt in the bank.
If no one has an account in the bank , the function should return NULLPTR.

If two or more couples meet the requirement and have the same highest savings, 
then the function return the pointer to anyof them.
